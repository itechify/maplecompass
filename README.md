# MapleCompass

A helper overlay for MapleStory Classic World. It reads the minimap title by ordinary screen capture and shows which map you are on. It never touches the game's memory, files or input ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-observe-game-from-outside-only.md)).

Personal use only for now: see [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-fetch-meowdb-live-until-permission.md).

## Layout

- `crates/compass-core`: the headless core (no OS or UI dependencies). Title Region frames go in, a panel state comes out. It is the only test seam.
- `src-tauri`: the Tauri v2 shell. It finds the "MapleStory" window, captures the Title Region about 3 times a second, feeds the core and moves the overlay.
- `src`, `index.html`: the overlay's web UI (vanilla TypeScript). It only renders the panel state.
- `samples/minimap`: test screenshots named `street-name__map-name[--variant].png`.

## Build, test, run (Windows)

Needs Rust (stable, MSVC), the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, Node and pnpm.

```sh
cargo test                                      # core tests (the default workspace member)
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev                                  # run the overlay beside the game
pnpm tauri build --debug --no-bundle            # build target/debug/maplecompass.exe
cargo run -p maplecompass --example probe       # no UI: capture the title and print what the core reads
```

Run the game windowed or borderless, with the minimap open.
